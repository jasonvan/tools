# Resistor Laboratory

## Prompt Used
I'd like you to design an app for my middle school electronics and design students to help them practice reading the colors on resistors.

I want it to show a big image of a resistor (you can use an SVG or three.js for this), and then have the lines. They have to guess what the resistance number is.

Also provide a button that you can click on to review how the numbers are calculated. Also provide a hint button that they can click on to perhaps reveal one color at a time to help them figure it out.
